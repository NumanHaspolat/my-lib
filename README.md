I combined the capabilities of Shadcn and Tailwind CSS to create "Shadwind UI", a comprehensive user interface library.

This innovative toolset leverages Shadcn's dynamic, shader-based UI components with Tailwind's first aid CSS framework, providing developers with a versatile and effective tool for designing visually stunning and highly customizable user interfaces.

Shadwind UI aims to simplify the development process by offering a wide range of pre-designed components and layout utilities that adhere to modern design principles;

It makes it easier than ever to create responsive, themed and interactive web applications.

## Note

I am aware that the library is not very useful, think of it as a shadcn clone, not a library.
